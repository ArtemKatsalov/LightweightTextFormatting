<h1>Laptop</h1>
<h2>Laptop definition</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">laptop</a> is a small, portable personal computer (PC).</p>
<p>Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is in the lower part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. </p>
<h2>Types of laptops</h2>
<p><strong>Mobile workstation</strong></p>
<p>Main articles: Mobile workstation and Desktop replacement computer
A mobile workstation, also known as a desktop-replacement computer, is a type of laptop that is significantly more powerful—and generally more expensive—than a standard laptop computer. They are generally intended for professional use and to serve as desktop replacements. Because of their high performance, however, they also have poorer battery life than most other laptops and require additional cooling systems. Examples of mobile workstations include the Thinkpad P-series and the HP ZBook line. </p>
<p><strong>Gaming laptop</strong></p>
<p>A gaming laptop is a type of laptop that is primarily used to play video games. Like mobile workstations, they are more powerful than standard laptops, but gaming laptops tend to prioritize features like a high refresh rate, a GPU that supports ray tracing, and RGB lighting. Examples of gaming laptops include the Lenovo Legion series and Alienware laptops.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid laptop</strong></p>
<p>The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.</p>
